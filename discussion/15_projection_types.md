To filter a query and get a projection as the result in Spring Data JPA, 
you can combine the projection with a query method that includes filtering criteria. 
Below, I'll show you how to do this with both interface-based and class-based projections.

### 1. Interface-based Projections with Filtering

Let's assume you have an `Employee` entity and you want to filter employees by their department 
and get only specific fields.

#### Employee Entity

```java
@Entity
public class Employee {
    @Id
    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
    private Long id;

    private String firstName;
    private String lastName;
    private String email;
    private String department;

    // getters and setters
}
```
#### Projection Interface

```java
public interface EmployeeProjection {
    String getFirstName();
    String getLastName();
    String getDepartment();
}
```

#### Repository with Filtering Method

```java
public interface EmployeeRepository extends JpaRepository<Employee, Long> {
    List<EmployeeProjection> findByDepartment(String department);
}
```

#### Usage

```java
@Autowired
private EmployeeRepository employeeRepository;

public void exampleUsage() {
    List<EmployeeProjection> employeesInIT = employeeRepository.findByDepartment("IT");
}
```

### 2. Class-based Projections with Filtering

For class-based projections, you can use a JPQL query with a constructor expression to select specific fields.

#### Projection Class

```java
public class EmployeeDTO {
    private String firstName;
    private String lastName;
    private String department;

    public EmployeeDTO(String firstName, String lastName, String department) {
        this.firstName = firstName;
        this.lastName = lastName;
        this.department = department;
    }

    // getters and setters
}
```

#### Repository with Filtering Method

```java
public interface EmployeeRepository extends JpaRepository<Employee, Long> {
    @Query("SELECT new com.example.EmployeeDTO(e.firstName, e.lastName, e.department) FROM Employee e WHERE e.department = :department")
    List<EmployeeDTO> findByDepartment(@Param("department") String department);
}
```

#### Usage

```java
@Autowired
private EmployeeRepository employeeRepository;

public void exampleUsage() {
    List<EmployeeDTO> employeesInHR = employeeRepository.findByDepartment("HR");
}
```

### 3. Dynamic Projections with Filtering

Dynamic projections allow you to specify the projection type at runtime along with filtering criteria.

#### Projection Interface

```java
public interface EmployeeView {
    String getFirstName();
    String getLastName();
    String getDepartment();
}
```

#### Repository with Dynamic Projection and Filtering Method

```java
public interface EmployeeRepository extends JpaRepository<Employee, Long> {
    <T> List<T> findByDepartment(String department, Class<T> type);
}
```

#### Usage

```java
@Autowired
private EmployeeRepository employeeRepository;

public void exampleUsage() {
    List<EmployeeView> employeeViewsInFinance = employeeRepository.findByDepartment("Finance", EmployeeView.class);
    List<EmployeeDTO> employeeDTOsInMarketing = employeeRepository.findByDepartment("Marketing", EmployeeDTO.class);
}
```

### Conclusion

By combining projections with query methods that include filtering criteria, you can efficiently retrieve 
only the necessary fields for entities that meet specific conditions. This approach helps in reducing 
the amount of data transferred and improves query performance.
